# Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Fundamentals of Computer Graphics** course, offered in the fourth semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on fundamental concepts and practical applications of computer graphics, covering:

- Raster and vector graphics principles (2D and 3D).
- Mathematical foundations and algorithms for graphics processing.
- Color models and conversions (RGB, CMY, HSL, HSV, etc.).
- Image processing techniques including filtering and transformations.
- Programming graphics applications using **SFML** and **wxWidgets**.
- 2D and 3D transformations, rendering techniques, and perspective projection.
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applications in image processing.
- File formats and data representation in computer graphics.
- Team project involving the creation of a graphical application.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using **C++** and **SFML**, with project work emphasizing team collaboration and efficient implementation of graphical applications.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to develop a strong foundation in computer graphics and its real-world applications.
